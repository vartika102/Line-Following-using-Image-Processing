# Line-Following-using-Image-Processing
This project needs an over head camera which takes the image of the path continously and send it to the laptop via a local network setup. The last pixel row of this image is then processed to check if the pixel values of the path are at the middle of the pixel row. Accordingly, error is calculated using pid, and this error is again used to calculate the change required in the motor speed. The calculated value is then sent to the microcontroller on the bot. This microcontroller now controls the speed of the bot so as to minimize the error and follow the path.
